Go-Video Inc., which makes video
cassette recorders, has agreed to accept cash settlements from three
defendants in a $1.5 billion antitrust suit, the firm's chairman
said.
   Chairman R. Terren Dunlap said Monday that his company had agreed
to accept settlements from Hitachi Ltd. of Japan, the Electronic
Industries Association of Japan and Goldstar Co. Ltd. of Korea.
   In return for the settlements, Go-Video agreed to dismiss the
three as defendants in the lawsuit.
   The suit, pending in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, alleges that
the defendants conspired to block the manufacture and marketing of
Go-Video's dual-deck video cassette recorder in the United States.
There originally were 26 defendants, including Japanese and Korean
manufacturers and the Motion Picture Association of America.
   Settlements have been reached with 17 of the defendants,
including the Motion Picture Association, Dunlap said.
   The terms of the settlements have not been disclosed because of
confidentiality agreements and a court order, Dunlap said.
   ``Although we can't reveal the amounts until we are required to
do so by law, we believe they properly reflect the seriousness in
which the defendants are taking the case,'' Dunlap said. ``Go-Video
is determined to recover its damages and ensure the availability of
the dual-deck VCR to the American public.
   Dunlap said the lawsuit is expected to go to trial in March.
   Go-Video holds a patent in the United States for a dual-deck VCR
tht it intends to market under the VCR-2 trademark.
